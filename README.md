# XTraffic-Accident Reporter
This project is a client-server backend prototype written for AngelHack Toronto, 2018 hackathon. 
It starts a server and allows clients to connect to it. 
Clients can post GPS coordinates of an accident site they witnessed or are aware of, for the other clients to see.


This is a prototype which uses python3 in linux. 
To activate the server, you have to type <<python XTraffic_server.py local host port>>.
The server will be active.
To connect a client you run <python XTraffic_client.py local host port>>
The client will be connected. You can connect as many clients as you want.
Then type report accident and follow the instructions.
Your desired accident location will be reported to the other clients.
